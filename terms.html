                    <h3>11.2 Dispute Resolution</h3>
                    <p>
                        Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Extension shall be resolved through good faith negotiation.
                        If a dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation, you agree to first contact the Developer at the contact information provided
                        in these Terms to attempt to resolve the dispute.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the
                        minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
                    </p>

                        These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and the Developer regarding the use
                        of the Extension and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral.

                    <p>
                        Your continued use of the Extension after such modifications constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree
                        to the modified Terms, you must stop using the Extension.
